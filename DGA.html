		<p>No, it’s not a Ryan PT-22. This two-place monowing Howard was one of several trainers stationed in Fayetteville during the Second World War. 
		One of the few surviving DGA-18Ks, N39668 was flown from late 1941 until March 1943 as a secondary trainer for pilots in the 305th College Training 
		Detachment. Cadets would receive primary training in the Piper J-3 Cub, then advance to the Howard.</p>		
		
		
		<p>Roughly 75 of the metal and fabric DGA-18s were built, making this a rare collectable. The forward fuselage of the DGA-18 is metal, with a fabric 
		covering from the cockpit to the rudder. The wings are wooden with a thin layer of mahogany plywood covering the ribs. The fabric covering the plywood 
		makes for a smooth, rivetless surface.</p>		
		
		<p>Fayetteville Flying Service made extensive use of the DGA-18K, owning four of these aircraft during the 1940s.</p>		
		
		<p>The Howard DGA-18K was donated to the Arkansas Air Museum by Robert Gast of Steger, Illinois.</p>

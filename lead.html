		<p>Born of the vision of Walter H. Beech’s faith in the latest technology, the Travel Air Company went from 900-feet of rented space in 1925 to the 
		world’s leading manufacturer of commercial aircraft in 1929. Having risen through the ranks from test pilot to general manager with Swallow Manufacturing, 
		Beech’s devotion to metal framing rather than wood led to his resignation. Setting up business in Wichita, Kansas, Beech committed Travel Air to the latest
		technology and quickly became an industry leader. The officers of Travel Air was a who’s who of the future of civil aviation in America: Walter P. Innes, Jr., 
		president and treasurer; Beech, secretary; Clyde Cessna, vice-president; and Lloyd Stearman, chief engineer. Among the early hallmarks of Travel Air was the first 
		commercial cabin aircraft with a completely faired-in liquid-cooled engine (1925), the first aircraft built to airline specifications (the Travel Air 5000 in 1926), 
		the first civilian aircraft to defeat the military speed competition (the Mystery Ship in 1929), establishment of the women’s altitude mark (1926 by Louise Thaden) 
		and victories in numerous aviation competitions. No wonder the front window of the company’s West Douglas street building read — “Large or Small, We Lead Them All.”</p>		
		
		
		<p>Beech’s company was a huge success by any measure. The company’s reputation for competitive success began with Beech himself. With Brice Goldsborough 
		as his navigator, Beech won the 1926 Ford Commercial Airplane Reliability Tour. Beech led over forty entrants in the twelve-day, fourteen-city tour to 
		capture the Edsel Ford Trophy. The next year, Art Goebel and William Davis flew Phillips Petroleum’s Woolaroc Travel Air from Oakland to Wheeler Field, Hawai’i, 
		to win the Dole Race and a $25,000 first prize. In 1928, Louise Thaden piloted a D-3000 to the first recorded women’s altitude record of 20,600, then used a D-4000 
		to win the first Women’s Air Derby from Santa Monica, Calif., to the National Air Races in Cleveland, Ohio.</p>		
		
		<p>Thaden’s exploits in the biplane D-4000 garnered great publicity for the company, but nothing compared with the victory of the Travel Air Model R — the Mystery Ship —
		at the 1929 National Air Races. Designed in secret in 1928, the low-wing monoplane became known as the Mystery Ship. The welded steel fuselage was sheet metal covered 
		at the cockpit and cowling with plywood aft. The wing was externally braced and plywood covered. Powered by the 425-horsepower Wright J-6-9, it was finished in time for
		Douglas Davis to shock the aviation world by winning the open entry National Air Races. A Curtiss Hawk P-3A finished second in the 50-mile course race, marking the first 
		time a civilian airplane beat a military model. Five Model Rs were built and were made famous by the likes of Pancho Barnes, James Haizlip and Frank Monroe Hawks.</p>		
		
		<p>Reaching 1,000 units in 1929, Travel Air became the world leader in both monoplane and biplane commercial aircraft. The combination of the economic 
		catastrophe of the stock market crash and a soft aviation market flooded with production from dozens of companies saw the end of numerous independent 
		manufacturers. Merging into one of the handful of national conglomerates, Travel Air joined with Curtiss-Wright Corporation. Beech became a vice-president, 
		but corporate life in New York City did not suit him. He left the company in 1932, returned to Wichita and in April 1932 founded Beech Aircraft Company. 
		Utilizing many of the principals that built Travel Air into an industry leader, Beech began to dominate the air races once again. His Model 17 — the Staggerwing — was
		visually stunning and in the hands of Thaden and Blanche Noyes shocked the aviation world in 1936. Not only did the upstart Beech win the nation’s most prestigious 
		cross-country race — Bendix Transcontinental — Thaden and Noyes beat their nearest male competitors by 45 minutes and set a new transcontinental speed record for women. 
		With a new slogan — It takes a Beechcraft to beat a Beechcraft — Walter Beech was on his way to dominating the commercial market once again.</p>

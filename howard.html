		<p>The Howard DGA (Damn Good Airplane)-11 was the commercial version of the famous 1935 Bendix and Thompson Cup winning DGA-6 
		“Mr. Mulligan” racing aircraft.  The Howard was custom-built and designed jointly by Benny Howard and Gordon Israel.  
		It was reportedly the fastest four-place personal airplane on the market.  The standard price for the DGA-11 would have been around 
		$16,500.  It was among the most costly aircraft to build and was often owned by the rich or movie stars.</p>
		
		<p>The Howard at the Arkansas Air and Military Museum is one of only five restored aircraft of this model left today.</p>

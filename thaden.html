		<h1>Aviation Pioneer Louise Thaden</h1>

		<p>The second-most famous American female pilot of the golden age of aviation, Louise McPhetridge Thaden became the first woman to win major flying 
		events and awards as well as setting world performance records. A colleague of Amelia Earhart, Thaden co-founded the Ninety-Nines, an international 
		organization for female pilots which continues to the present day. While history remembered Earhart from the publicity of her over-water flights and 
		her mysterious death, Thaden was every bit the celebrity of Earhart during the 1930s.</p>		
		
		
		<p>She defeated both Earhart and Pancho Barnes to win the first Women’s Air Derby, a transcontinental race from Santa Monica, Calif., to the site of the 1929 
		National Air Races in Cleveland, Ohio. She and co-pilot Blanche Noyes captured the 1936 Bendix Cup race, winning the New York to Los Angeles event in the first 
		year women were eligible to compete. As a result, Thaden received aviation’s highest honor, the Harmon Trophy, in 1936. “We had to prove that women were as good 
		pilots,” Thaden said. “In an age where some men didn’t think a woman should drive a horse and buggy, much less drive an automobile, it was a job to prove that 
		females could fly.”</p>		
		
		<p>The aviation pioneer was born in Bentonville, Ark., the daughter of Roy and Edna McPhetridge. She was raised in the small northwest Arkansas town, 
		graduating from local Bentonville High, and attending the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville between 1921 and 1925. Majoring first in journalism, 
		then switching to physical education, Thaden left college after her junior year, and in 1927 pursued a job with Travel Air Corporation as a salesperson 
		for the Wichita, Kan., based aircraft manufacturer. She was dispatched to Travel Air’s San Francisco sales office.</p>		
		
		<p>During the height of her aviation achievements, she had a son, Bill, in 1930 and daughter, Pat, in 1933. In 1935, Thaden worked for the Bureau of Air 
		Commerce promoting marking of airfields and landmarks nationwide. She published her memoirs in 1938 entitled High, Wide and Frightened. Active in the Civil 
		Air Patrol during the Second World War, she reached the rank of lieutenant colonel. The Bentonville airport was renamed Louise Thaden Field in 1951, and a 
		building at the National Staggerwing Museum was named in her honor in 1974. She died of a heart attack in High Point, N.C.</p>

		<p>The Allison TF-41, also known as the Rolls Royce Spry, was used by several aircraft during the 1960s and 1970s. 
		The turbofan engine produced 14,500 pounds of thrust. It was later developed on into a turboprop YT-56-A-3 
		that was originally designed for the Lockheed C-130.</p>
		
		<p>The USAF version of the Vought A-7D Corsair II employed the Allison. The U.S. Navy’s A-7E used the TF-41-A2, 
		and remains in service today.</p>
		
		<p>The Allison is a double display. The TF-41-A rests on a Model 4000A removal trailer built by the 
		Regent Jack Company. The ETU-8/E trailer is used to remove and install engines on jet aircraft.</p>
		
		<p>Both the TF-41 and the ETU-8/E removal trailer are on loan to the A.A.M. from the National Museum of Naval Aviation in Pensacola, Florida.</p>

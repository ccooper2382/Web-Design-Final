		<p>An ace fighter pilot for the Army Air Service in the First World War, Field Kindley ranked third in downed aircraft among U.S.A.A.S. 
		pilots with 12 confirmed kills. Recepient of the British Distinguished Flying Cross and an Oak Leaf Cluster for the American Distinguished 
		Service Cross, Kindley commanded the 148th Squadron in France from August 1918 until the end of the war. Born March 13, 1896, near the 
		Civil War battlefield at Pea Ridge, Ark., to George C. and Ella Kindley, his mother died before his third birthday. After Ella’s death 
		in 1898, George accepted a teaching position in the Philippines, leaving young Field to be raised by his grandmother, Cynthia Kindley, 
		of Bentonville. At seven, Field rejoined his father in Manila for five years, then in 1908 moved back to Arkansas to live with his uncle 
		in Gravette. After high school graduation, he moved to Coffeyville, Kan., to become a partner in a motion picture theater.</p>		
		
		
		<p>It was from Coffeyville that Kindley enlisted in the Kansas National Guard after America’s entry into the First World War. Originally posted as 
		a foot soldier, Kindley volunteered for transfer into the aviation branch of the Army Signal Corps. Sent to the School of Military Aeronautics at the 
		University of Illinois, Kindley’s natural talents moved him into the first class of American pilots transferred from ground school to England for flight 
		training in September 1917. He was commissioned as a first lieutenant in the American Air Service on April 15, 1918.</p>		
		
		<p>His first assignment was as a ferry pilot moving aircraft from England to the western front. It almost was his only assignment as heavy fog on 
		May 5, 1918, resulted in his crashing a Sopwith Camel biplane into the famous White Cliffs at Dover, England. Recovering from injuries in an English 
		hospital, Kindley’s his first combat assignment was to the Royal Air Force’s 65th Squadron. It was with the 65th Squadron that Kindley scored his 
		first kill over Albert, France. Kindley shot down Lieutenant Wilhelm Lehmann, commanding officer of the German Jagdstaffel 5, on June 26.</p>		
		
		<p>In July 1918, the Americans formed the 148th Squadron, which was assigned to serve in the British sector of the western front. Kindley was one of 
		the first pilots posted to the new unit. On July 13, Kindley earned the 148th’s first victory by shooting down a German Albatros D-3 over Ypres. The 
		win earned Kindley brief celebrity on the British front, and he soon became the commanding officer of the 148th after “Bim” Oliver was forced into an
		English hospital in late July. Later promoted to captain, Kindley’s twelve confirmed kills ranked him third in aircraft shot down during the war behind 
		Captain Eddie Rickenbacker and Major Raoul Lufbery.</p>		
		
			<p>His final action came on Oct. 28 with his 12th kill, a Fokker near Bapaume, France. After the war, Kindley was posted on December 17, 1919, to the 
			94th Aero Squadron at Kelly Field near San Antonio, Texas. As a member of the “Hat-in-the-Ring” 94th, Kindley was assigned to take part in a demonstration 
			for General John J. Pershing in February 1920. His flight of SE-5 biplanes was scheduled to perform strafing and bombing runs. On February 1, the day before
			Pershing’s visit, Kindley rehersed the bombing run. Diving into his target, he discovered a group of enlisted men had wandered into the area. In an attempt 
			to warn the troops, Kindley buzzed the area. When he pulled up, the engine stalled and the SE-5 fell from an altitude of almost 100 feet, killing Kindley.
			The subsequent inquiry found that support wires broke from the strain of his maneuver to warn the soldiers. Kindley’s body was returned to Gravette for burial. 
			Several monuments remain to the World War flying ace. Gravette’s city park, a Coffeyville high school and a Second World War air base in Bermuda were all named 
			for Kindley.</p>
